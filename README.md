Our Decentralized Non-Profit Crowdfunding Platform project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the front-end, while Solidity and Blockchain technology will be used to automate the donation process and ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. The platform will be deployed over Netlify for easy front-end deployment and a third web infrastructure for decentralized Smart Contract execution. 

The platform will feature a user-friendly interface, a dashboard for tracking donations and their impact, a rating system for non-profit organizations, and a dispute resolution mechanism. Our Agile development approach ensures regular updates and stakeholder feedback. Our goal is to develop a scalable and functional platform that meets the needs of non-profit organizations and donors, and ultimately contributes to creating a better world for all.
